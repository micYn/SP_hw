/*
 * lookup6 : does no looking up locally, but instead asks
 * a server for the answer. Communication is by shared memory
 *
 * Synchronization is by two semaphores:
 *   One excludes other clients while we talk to server
 *   The other is used BOTH to alert the server and to await his reply
 *   Client raises a semaphore by 2. Server drops by 1 before and
 *   after doing lookup
 * The same key (which is passed as resource) is used BOTH 
 * for shared memory & semaphores.
